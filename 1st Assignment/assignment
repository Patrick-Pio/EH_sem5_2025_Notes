1ST Assignment

1. Initial Access (April 29, 2021)
•	Hackers gained entry into Colonial Pipeline's network using a compromised password for a VPN (Virtual Private Network) account.
       What went wrong:
•	The VPN account was inactive but not disabled.
•	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) was not enabled.
       How it could have been prevented:
•	Disable unused accounts immediately.
•	Enforce MFA on all remote access systems.

2. Infiltration by DarkSide Ransomware Group
•	The threat actors belonged to a cybercriminal group called DarkSide.
•	After gaining access, they moved laterally within the network, identifying key systems to encrypt.
•	They targeted the IT (Information Technology) systems, not the pipeline's operational controls (OT systems).
        What went wrong:
•	Lack of network segmentation allowed lateral movement.
•	Inadequate monitoring of internal activity.
       How it could have been prevented:
•	Implement network segmentation to limit access between systems.
•	Use Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) and log monitoring to detect abnormal activity.

3. Ransomware Deployment (May 7, 2021)
•	The attackers deployed ransomware, encrypting around 100 GB of critical business data.
•	They exfiltrated data beforehand to use as leverage for a double extortion—threatening to release stolen data if the ransom wasn’t paid.
       What went wrong:
•	Colonial had no behavioral ransomware detection in place.
•	No data loss prevention measures to block exfiltration.
       How it could have been prevented:
•	Use ransomware-specific defenses like file behavior analytics.
•	Apply Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to detect and block outbound data theft.


4. Colonial Pipeline Shuts Down Operations
•	Out of caution and fear of the attack spreading, Colonial voluntarily shut down the pipeline.
•	This led to a massive fuel supply disruption across the U.S. East Coast.
What went wrong:
•	No clear separation between IT (business) and OT (operations) networks.
•	No tested incident response plan for cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.
How it could have been prevented:
•	Isolate OT systems from internet-facing IT networks.
•	Develop and routinely test an incident response plan tailored to ransomware scenarios.

5. Ransom Paid in Cryptocurrency
•	Colonial Pipeline paid 75 Bitcoin (around $4.4 million USD) to DarkSide for a decryption tool.
•	However, the tool worked very slowly, so Colonial mostly relied on its own backups to restore operations.
What went wrong:
•	The company was not confident in backup recovery.
•	Paying ransom incentivized future attacks.
How it could have been prevented:
•	Maintain robust, regularly tested offline backups.
•	Ensure backups are segregated from the main network to avoid encryption.

6. Aftermath and FBI Response
•	On May 12, 2021, Colonial resumed full pipeline operations.
•	The FBI recovered part of the ransom (~63.7 BTC) by tracking the payment and accessing a wallet.
•	The U.S. government intensified efforts on cybersecurity for critical infrastructure following the attack.
       What went wrong:
•	Colonial lacked real-time reporting and public-private threat sharing at the time of the attack.
      How it could have been prevented:
•	Foster real-time communication with law enforcement and security agencies.
•	Participate in Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) for critical infrastructure.
